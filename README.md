🤖 Financial Competence Analysis AI - Prototype 📊
This repository contains a prototype for a web-based tool designed to analyze financial documents. The tool leverages a large language model to generate concise summaries and insightful analytical prompts from complex financial texts.

This prototype serves as a "trailer" 🎬 or proof-of-concept for the research plan submitted for the FOSSEE internship.

🚀 Live Demo
A live demo of this prototype is hosted using GitHub Pages. You can access it here:

✨ How It Works
📋 Paste Text: The user pastes a block of financial text (e.g., from an earnings report or market analysis) into the input area.

🔎 Analyze: The user clicks the "Analyze Financial Text" button.

🎯 Get Insights: The application simulates a call to an AI model and returns:

A high-level summary of the text.

A list of meaningful, analytical prompts that a financial analyst might ask to dig deeper.

📝 Note: This is a front-end-only prototype. The AI response is currently hardcoded for demonstration purposes to showcase the user interface and the intended functionality. The next step would be to integrate a live LLM backend.
